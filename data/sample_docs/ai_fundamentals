Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning – Fundamentals
1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
programmed to think and learn. AI systems can perform tasks such as problem-solving, speech
recognition, decision-making, and pattern recognition.
2. Types of Artificial Intelligence
AI can be categorized into Narrow AI, General AI, and Super AI. Narrow AI is task-specific, while
General and Super AI are theoretical concepts.
3. Machine Learning Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without explicit
programming. ML models improve with experience.
4. Types of Machine Learning
Supervised Learning uses labeled data, Unsupervised Learning finds patterns in unlabeled data,
and Reinforcement Learning learns through rewards and penalties.
5. Natural Language Processing
NLP focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Common tasks include text classification and question answering.
6. Large Language Models
LLMs are deep learning models trained on vast text data. They can generate human-like text but
may hallucinate without grounding.
7. Vector Embeddings
Vector embeddings represent text as numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning and enable
similarity search.
8. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
RAG combines retrieval and generation by providing relevant document context to language
models, reducing hallucinations.
9. Applications of RAG
Document question answering, enterprise search, AI chatbots, and knowledge base systems.
10. Conclusion
RAG-based systems improve accuracy and reliability by grounding language models in external
documents
